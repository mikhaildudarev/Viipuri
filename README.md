![App Preview](https://github.com/mikhaildudarev/Viipuri/blob/main/Resources/Preview/app_preview.png)

To make the app work please start local server on port `8000` to host assets located in `Resources/Hosted` folder. 

On the mac you can use `SimpleHTTPServer` to achieve that, for example:
```bash
cd ~/Developer/Viipuri/Resources/Hosted
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
